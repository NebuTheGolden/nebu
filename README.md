# NEBU
forked from TEE and HEHE. Nebu is the Egyptian symbol of gold, as we identify the symbolism between AI and wealth creation.

### WHAT'S NEW:

- Text-to-image generation as a form of memetic replies for interactions.
- Added image context capabilities to allow the agent to understand memes in both text and image.
- Added Bitquery support to support actual Pump Fun data gathering for its reasoning.

### Running the agent:

docker-compose up -d

This will start the agent in the background and run continuously.

You can also run the agent manually by running:

python run_pipeline.py

This will run the pipeline LOCALLY and not in the container.
